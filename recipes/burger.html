        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
            beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li> ½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li> ¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper,
                and
                oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about
                10
                minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and
                season
                with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread
                crumbs
                have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time,
                into
                patties.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet
                until
                golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
